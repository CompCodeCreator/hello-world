# hello-world
I am turning over a leaf....

I am applying for a coding school soon.  I am excited to decide on an accounting program, or coding program, with the intent to do both.  I have been using the Codeacademy website to try to learn some code so far.  Currently, I am trying to debug my rock, paper, and scissors game.  My biggest concern about coding, is trying to find a job in northern Colorado.  I am close to my family, and want to live and work here!
